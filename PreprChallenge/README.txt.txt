Hello, firstly I would like to say that I appreciated the opportunity for this internship and would like to thank the interviewer who is taking the time to review my submission.

My plan for the redesign was to keep a consistent scheme across all five webpages. I opted for a colour scheme that matched with the Prepr logo which included the soft pastel colors.

I approached the challenge page and explore page similarly. I decided to take a box approach where more items could be visible on the screen.  I did this so the user could feel as if they could find what they are looking for faster.

In the sketch folder you will find all my planning sketches.
In the assets folder is all images used in the project.
In the styles folder is all css files used.
